# so_long
Here is my first graphic project.

The goal is to achieve a simple 2D game wich end when all the collectible are picked up.

The rules:

You have to use the mlx wich is the graphic library from 42.
You have to parse the entire map and check if there's some missing items or if the map is open.
Like all C project from 42 you have to follow the 42 norm and leaks are not allowed.

You want to play with it? Start a beautifull shell and type > Make && ./so_long "and the map name you want to play".
